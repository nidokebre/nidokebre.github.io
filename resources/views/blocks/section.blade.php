          <p><br>The Integration + Innovation Design Lab studies and applies the integrated design methodology to create innovative products and services. 
          We integrate design, ergonomics, engineering, technology, and business into our design process. Our objective extends beyond developing conceptual designs; we strive to transform them into tangible products and services that are practical for people to use. 
          This the way to create useful design knowledge in IIDLab.<br>
          <br>
          We employ systematic and human-centered design methods to create innovative design concepts and utilize engineering design techniques to implement them. 
          Our approach involves rigorous testing and validation of integrated design methods to ensure their effectiveness. <br>
          <br>
          Our primary research focuses on product-service system designs in elderly care, rehabilitation, healthcare, and safety. We actively collaborate with medical doctors, 
          social welfare experts, physical exercise trainers, rehabilitation therapists, production engineers, and other relevant professionals to achieve our goals.<br> 
          <br> 
          IID Lab has published world-class research papers and received top design awards. Furthermore, the students involved in our research projects gain integrated knowledge 
          and experience necessary to lead new product design and development and have continued successful careers after graduation.
