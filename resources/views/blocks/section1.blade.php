        <br>
        By 2060, it is projected that one out of every two people will be elderly. To prepare for this elderly-centered society, we have been actively researching and developing product-service systems that support the elderly in living independently, securely, and comfortably. One of our main focuses is designing and developing robot-service ecosystems dedicated to elderly care to help them maintain their independence throughout their senior years.

        <br>
        We research intelligent product-service systems that leverage data to facilitate easy exercise, assist in health management, and develop rehabilitation training devices that offer diagnosis, prescription, and training capabilities in one device. Our emphasis on exercise equipment is to motivate and enable continuous monitoring of exercise status, making it easier for middle-aged and elderly individuals to manage their health. In rehabilitation training devices, we aim to develop compact products and services that intelligently integrate diagnosis, prescription, and training, all within a single device. This enhances patient accessibility, allows for convenient training at home, and reduces the burden on doctors and occupational therapists..

        <br>
        Safety and comfort are of utmost importance in every industry. We actively research methods and develop product-service solutions that promote safe and convenient work practices across various job sites. For example, we have designed and implemented brainwave-based smart safety helmets suitable for industrial environments. Additionally, we have developed specialized backpacks tailored to meet the unique demands of special forces personnel in their specific duties.
